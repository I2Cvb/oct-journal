\subsection{Experiment \#3}\label{subsec:exp3}
This experiment replicates the \emph{Experiment \#2} for the case of low-level representation of \ac{lbp} and \ac{lbptop} features extracted using \emph{global}-mapping.

The obtained results from this experiment are listed in Appendix~\ref{app:1}~-~Table~\ref{tab:table4}.
In this experiment, flattening the B-scan boosts the results of the best performing configuration.
However, its effects is not consistent across all the configurations.
\ac{rf} has a better performance by achieving better \ac{se} (81.2\%, 75.0\%, 68.7\%), while \ac{svm} achieve the highest \ac{sp} (93.7\%), see Appendix~\ref{app:1}~-~Table~\ref{tab:table4}.

In terms of classifier, \ac{rf} has a better performance than the others despite the fact that the highest \ac{sp} is achieved using \ac{svm}.
