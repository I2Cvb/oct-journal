\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp} 
A set of three experiments is designed to test the influence of the different blocks of the proposed framework in comparison to our previous work~\cite{Lemaintre2015miccaiOCT}.
These experiments are designed such as: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] \emph{Experiment~\#1} evaluates the effects of number of words used in \ac{bow} (high-level representation).
\item[(ii)] \emph{Experiment~\#2} evaluates the effects of different pre-processing steps and classifiers on high-level representation.
\item[(iii)] \emph{Experiment~\#3} evaluates the effects of different pre-processing steps and classifiers on low-level representation.
\end{enumerate}
Table~\ref{tab:experiment_summary} reports the experiments which have been carried out in \cite{Lemaintre2015miccaiOCT} as a baseline and outlines the complementary experimentation here proposed.
The reminder of this section details the common configuration parameters across the experiments, while the detailed explanations are presented in the following 
subsections. 

All the experiments are performed using a private dataset (see Sect.\,\ref{sec:exp:dataset:seri}) and are reported as presented in Sect.\,\ref{sec:exp:validation}.
In all the experiments, \ac{lbp} and \ac{lbptop} features are extracted using both \emph{local} and \emph{global}-mapping for different sampling points of 8, 16, and 24 for radius of 1, 2, and 3 pixels, respectively.
The partitioning for \emph{local}-mapping is set to ($7 \times 7$) pixels patch for 2D \ac{lbp} and ($ 7 \times 7 \times 7$) pixels sub-volume for \ac{lbptop}.

\subsection{SERI-Dataset}\label{sec:exp:dataset:seri}
This dataset was acquired by the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), using CIRRUS TM (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) \ac{sdoct} device. The dataset consists of 32 \ac{oct} volumes (16 \ac{dme} and 16 normal cases). Each volume contains 128 B-scan with resolution of 512 $\times$ 1024 pixels.
All \ac{sdoct} images are read and assessed by trained graders and identified as normal or \ac{dme} cases based on evaluation of retinal thickening, hard exudates, intraretinal cystoid space formation and subretinal fluid.

\subsection{Validation}\label{sec:exp:validation}

  \label{fig:CM}
\end{figure}

All the experiments are evaluated in terms of \acf{se} and \acf{sp} using the \ac{lopocv} strategy, in line with \cite{Lemaintre2015miccaiOCT}.
\ac{se} and \ac{sp} are statistics driven from the confusion matrix as depicted in Fig.\,\ref{fig:CM}.
The \ac{se} evaluates the performance of the classifier with respect to the positive class, while the \ac{sp} evaluates its performance with respect to negative class.
The use of \ac{lopocv} implies that at each round, a pair \ac{dme}-normal volume is selected for testing while the remaining volumes are used for training.
Subsequently, no \ac{se} or \ac{sp} variance can be reported.
However, \ac{lopocv} strategy has been adopted despite this limitation due to the reduced size of the dataset.
