Abstract
--------

This paper addresses the problem of automatic classification of SD-OCT data for automatic identification of patients with DME versus normal subjects. OCT has been a valuable diagnostic tool for DME, which is among the most common causes of irreversible vision loss in individuals with diabetes. Here, a classification framework with five distinctive steps is proposed and we present an extensive study of each step. Our method considers combination of various pre-processings in conjunction with LBP features and different mapping strategies. Using linear and non-linear classifiers, we tested the developed framework on a balanced cohort of 32 patients.

Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous studies by achieving a SE and SP of 81.2% and 93.7%, respectively. Our study concludes that the 3D features and high-level representation of 2D features using patches achieve the best results. However, the effects of pre-processing is inconsistent with respect to different classifiers and feature configurations.
